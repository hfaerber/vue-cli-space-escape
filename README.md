# Space Escape - Take 2 - Using Vue Cli
[Heather Faerber](https://github.com/hfaerber)

I was assigned to build a very simple application using Vue.js - a framework that I had never used or been taught.  My initial attempt followed a very simple set up and was deployable without running into issues. However, it was too simple to be able to test so I had to build this repo and migrate the application here so that it would have the capacity to test.  This process proved far more challenging and left no time to test before the project was due.
